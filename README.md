pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create `.env` file with the following variables:

 ___Mandatory variables___

- `DATABASE_URL` = sqlite:////home/user/project/db.sqlite3

    SCHEMA and PATH to Database based on [type-casting methods of environ.Env](https://django-environ.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types.html#environ-env-db-url)

    The absolute path to the directory where collectstatic will collect static files for deployment.

- `MEDIA_URL` = '/media/'

## Add location using command

There is an additional utility `load_place` to help in uploading json data into database.
